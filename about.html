    <h1>About Our Project - Windy üå¶Ô∏è</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Windy, a weather app developed as part of a group project at the <strong>University of Greater Manchester</strong>.
      This project leverages various modern technologies and practices to deliver a reliable and scalable weather forecasting platform.
    </p>

    <div class="info-section">
      <h2>Key Technologies and Services:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS (Amazon Web Services)</strong>: Our platform is hosted on AWS using S3 for static web hosting and Lambda for serverless computing.</li>
        <li><strong>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)</strong>: We use GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Lambda API Integration</strong>: The app fetches real-time weather data via API calls to AWS Lambda, ensuring dynamic content delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The app is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes, providing an excellent user experience on both desktop and mobile.</li>
        <li><strong>User Authentication</strong>: We have integrated a simple authentication system using local storage for managing user sessions.</li>

      <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to provide an intuitive, easy-to-use weather forecasting tool while incorporating modern technologies like serverless computing with AWS and automating our workflows using CI/CD practices.
